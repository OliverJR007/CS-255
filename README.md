The DriverPass project was developed for a client named DriverPass, a company focused on helping customers prepare for driving tests by offering online courses, practice exams, and on-the-road driving lessons. The client wanted a web-based system that would allow students to register, purchase packages, schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, and track their progress. Additionally, the system needed to support different user roles such as admin, IT staff, and drivers, with secure access control and activity tracking.

What I Did Well

One area in which I excelled was capturing the client’s functional and non-functional requirements and translating them into UML diagrams. My use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams accurately reflected the interactions between the system components and the users. I also provided clear documentation that nontechnical stakeholders could understand.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would focus on simplifying and refining the class diagram. While it included the necessary classes and relationships, I believe I could improve its organization and reduce complexity by grouping related attributes more logically and clearly labeling relationships. This would make the diagram easier for developers to implement and for the client to review.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted user needs by analyzing the transcript and business requirements, then mapping each requirement to a system feature. For example, the client requested scheduling functionality for driving lessons, so I included use cases and diagrams showing appointment booking, cancellation, and confirmation via email/SMS. Considering user needs is crucial because a system that doesn’t align with client expectations will fail to deliver value. User-centered design ensures usability, satisfaction, and business success.

Approach to Designing Software

When designing software, I start by gathering and validating requirements, then break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. I use techniques like UML modeling, prototyping, and iterative feedback loops to ensure the design meets user expectations. In the future, I would incorporate Agile strategies more deeply, such as building incremental prototypes for early feedback and using tools for better traceability between requirements and implementation.
